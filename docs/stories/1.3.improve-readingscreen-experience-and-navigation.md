## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion notes: Critical unit tests were missing and need to be prioritized. The implementation should follow the same testing standards established in the previous stories.

### Data Models
- **Chapter Model**: Located at `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/domain/model/Chapter.kt` [Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md]
- **Reading Settings**: Managed by `ReadingSettingsViewModel` with persistent storage via DataStore [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]
- **Progress Tracking**: Should integrate with existing Room database for local persistence [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

### API Specifications
- **Chapter API**: `/chapters` endpoint for chapter management [Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md]
- **Progress API**: Integration with backend for progress synchronization
- **Reading Settings**: Local storage via DataStore preferences [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]

### Component Specifications
- **ReadingScreen**: Located at `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/ui/screens/ReadingScreen.kt`
- **ReadingSettingsDialog**: Located at `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/ui/components/ReadingSettingsDialog.kt`
- **ReadingSettingsViewModel**: Located at `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/ui/viewmodel/ReadingSettingsViewModel.kt`
- **Material 3 Design System**: Must follow established theming patterns [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

### File Locations
Based on Clean Architecture pattern [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]:
- **UI Layer**: `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/ui/screens/ReadingScreen.kt`
- **ViewModel**: `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/ui/viewmodel/ReadingSettingsViewModel.kt`
- **Components**: `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/ui/components/`
- **Data Layer**: `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/data/local/` for progress persistence
- **Domain Models**: `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/domain/model/`

### Technical Constraints
- **Kotlin Version**: 2.0.21 with Compose compiler [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Jetpack Compose**: 2024.09.00 with Material 3 design system [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt 2.48 for DI [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Local Storage**: Room 2.6.1 for database, DataStore for preferences [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with MVVM [Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-and-conventions.md]

### Performance Considerations
- **Reactive Programming**: Use Kotlin Flows for data streams [Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-and-conventions.md]
- **Image Loading**: Coil 2.5.0 for any image components [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Memory Management**: Proper state management to avoid memory leaks
- **Smooth Animations**: Use Compose animations for transitions

### Testing
- **Test Location**: `app/src/test/java/` for unit tests [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]
- **Testing Framework**: Standard Android testing frameworks
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for ViewModel business logic and repository methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test reading flow end-to-end
- **UI Tests**: Test reading interface interactions and navigation

### Project Structure Notes
The current ReadingScreen implementation follows the established Clean Architecture pattern. All enhancements must maintain this structure and integrate properly with existing components like ReadingSettingsDialog and ReadingSettingsViewModel.
