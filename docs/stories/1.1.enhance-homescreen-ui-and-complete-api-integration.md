- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt modules in `app/di/` directory [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]

### Technical Constraints
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with Domain, Data, and Presentation layers [Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-and-conventions.md]

- **Test Coverage**: Current minimal coverage - focus on critical functionality testing
- **Running Tests**: Use `./gradlew :app:test` for frontend tests [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]
- **Testing Standards**: Follow Kotlin conventions and include tests for ViewModels and Repository implementations

### Project Structure Notes
The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation between:
- Domain layer (`app/domain/`) - Business logic and models
- Data layer (`app/data/`) - Repository implementations and data sources
- Presentation layer (`app/ui/`) - UI components and ViewModels

All new components should follow this structure and be placed in appropriate directories based on their functionality.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural practices with clean separation of concerns. The HomeScreen UI follows Material 3 design principles with proper visual hierarchy, and the API integration is well-structured using the repository pattern. The code is maintainable and follows Android best practices. However, the lack of comprehensive test coverage is a significant concern for a production-ready application.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. The code quality is already at a good standard with proper:
- Clean Architecture implementation
- MVVM pattern with proper separation of concerns
- Material 3 design system usage
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Haptic feedback integration

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Kotlin conventions and Android best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Clean Architecture pattern properly implemented
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing comprehensive test coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria have been implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Visual hierarchy enhancement completed with proper typography
- [x] API integration completed for all novel sections
- [x] Loading states implemented with skeleton screens
- [x] Error handling implemented with user-friendly messages
- [x] Navigation and UX optimizations completed
- [x] Haptic feedback integrated throughout
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add unit tests for HomeViewModel business logic
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Add integration tests for repository methods
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Add UI tests for error states and loading scenarios
- [ ] Consider adding performance tests for parallel API calls

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation uses standard Android security practices with proper data handling through the repository pattern. No sensitive data is exposed in the UI layer.

### Performance Considerations

Performance is well-optimized with:
- Parallel API calls implemented in HomeViewModel
- Efficient data loading with proper state management
- Skeleton loading screens for better perceived performance
- Proper use of LazyRow for horizontal scrolling

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. The implementation is already at a good quality standard.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-enhance-homescreen-ui-and-complete-api-integration.yml
Risk profile: High risk due to lack of test coverage
NFR assessment: Security and Performance PASS, Reliability CONCERNS due to untested error handling

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Critical test coverage gaps must be addressed before production deployment
