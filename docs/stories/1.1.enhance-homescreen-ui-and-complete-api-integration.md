# Story 1.1: Enhance HomeScreen UI and Complete API Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** novel reader,
**I want** an improved home screen with better visual hierarchy and complete data integration,
**so that** I can easily discover and access novels with a polished, professional interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. HomeScreen displays improved visual hierarchy with better spacing and typography
2. All novel data sections (banner, recommended, ranking, new, completed) are properly populated from API
3. Loading states are improved with skeleton screens or better progress indicators
4. Error states provide clear feedback and retry options
5. Navigation between sections is smooth and intuitive
6. All existing functionality remains intact

## Tasks / Subtasks

### API Specifications
- **Main Endpoints**: `/novels`, `/auth`, `/users`, `/chapters`, `/reviews`, `/comments` [Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md]
- **OpenAPI Spec**: Available at `/swagger-ui.html` when backend is running [Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md]
- **API Services**: Located in `app/data/remote/api/` directory [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]

### Component Specifications
- **Current HomeScreen**: `app/src/main/java/com/miraimagiclab/novelreadingapp/ui/screens/BookListScreen.kt` [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]
- **UI Components**: Located in `app/ui/components/` directory [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]
- **Theme System**: Located in `app/ui/theme/` directory [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]
- **ViewModels**: Located in `app/ui/viewmodel/` directory [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]

### File Locations
- **Repository Pattern**: Data abstraction layer in `app/data/repository/` [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]
- **Remote Data Sources**: API services in `app/data/remote/api/` [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]
- **Navigation Setup**: `app/navigation/NovelReadingNavigation.kt` [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt modules in `app/di/` directory [Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]

### Technical Constraints
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with Domain, Data, and Presentation layers [Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-and-conventions.md]
- **UI Pattern**: MVVM with Jetpack Compose UI [Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-and-conventions.md]
- **Data Flow**: Repository Pattern with Kotlin Flows for reactive programming [Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-and-conventions.md]
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt for DI [Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-and-conventions.md]

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Unit tests should be placed alongside source files following Kotlin conventions
- **Testing Framework**: Use standard Android testing frameworks (JUnit, Mockito)
- **Test Coverage**: Current minimal coverage - focus on critical functionality testing
- **Running Tests**: Use `./gradlew :app:test` for frontend tests [Source: architecture/testing-reality.md]
- **Testing Standards**: Follow Kotlin conventions and include tests for ViewModels and Repository implementations

### Project Structure Notes
The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation between:
- Domain layer (`app/domain/`) - Business logic and models
- Data layer (`app/data/`) - Repository implementations and data sources
- Presentation layer (`app/ui/`) - UI components and ViewModels

All new components should follow this structure and be placed in appropriate directories based on their functionality.
