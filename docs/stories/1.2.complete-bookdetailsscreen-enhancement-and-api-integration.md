- Hilt for dependency injection
- Kotlin Flows for reactive programming

**Tech Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md]:
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Material 3 design system
- Retrofit for API communication
- Coil for image loading
- Room for local caching

**Performance Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture/performance-considerations.md]:
- Use parallel API calls for better performance
- Implement proper caching with Room database
- Use Coil for efficient image loading
- Optimize Compose recomposition

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture-patterns-and-conventions.md]:
- Unit tests for ViewModel business logic
- Integration tests for repository methods
- UI tests for error states and loading scenarios
- Test file location: `app/src/test/java/` and `app/src/androidTest/java/`
- Use JUnit and Mockito for unit testing
- Use Espresso for UI testing

**Critical Testing Requirements**:
- Test all API integrations with proper error handling
- Test loading states and error states for each tab
- Test navigation between chapters
- Test comment and review display functionality
- Test recommendation navigation

### Project Structure Notes
The current implementation follows the established Clean Architecture pattern with proper separation of concerns. The BookDetailsScreen exists but needs enhancement to fully integrate with all available API endpoints and provide complete functionality for all tabs.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-12-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent architecture and comprehensive functionality. The BookDetailsScreen is well-structured with all required tabs (Overview, Chapters, Comments, Reviews, Recommendations) properly implemented. The API integration uses parallel calls for optimal performance, and error handling is robust with proper fallbacks for partial API failures. The UI follows Material 3 design principles with comprehensive loading states, error states, and empty states.

**Strengths:**
- Clean Architecture implementation with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive UI with all acceptance criteria met
- Excellent error handling with graceful degradation
- Parallel API calls for optimal performance
- Proper data mapping and caching implementation
- Material 3 design system adherence

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed as the code quality is already high and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Kotlin and Android best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Adheres to Clean Architecture patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing unit tests as claimed in story
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria are fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified comprehensive API integration with parallel calls
- [x] Confirmed all tabs are properly implemented with data display
- [x] Validated error handling and loading states
- [x] Checked Material 3 design system compliance
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add unit tests for NovelDetailViewModel business logic
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add unit tests for NovelDetailRepositoryImpl API integration
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for API error scenarios
- [ ] Add UI tests for error states and loading scenarios

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly handles API responses and doesn't expose sensitive data.

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance implementation with parallel API calls using coroutines. The repository pattern with caching reduces redundant network requests. Image loading with Coil is properly implemented.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-complete-bookdetailsscreen-enhancement-and-api-integration.yml
Risk profile: High risk due to missing unit tests
NFR assessment: Performance and reliability are well-implemented

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Critical unit tests must be added before production deployment
(Story owner decides final status)
