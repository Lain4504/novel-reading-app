### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Improve user experience through better UI/UX design
- Complete missing API integrations and UI components
- Eliminate authentication errors that disrupt user experience
- Create a polished, production-ready mobile reading application

#### Background Context
The current Novel Reading App has a solid foundation with Jetpack Compose UI and Spring Boot backend, but the user interface needs refinement and some API integrations are incomplete. Additionally, the token refresh mechanism has issues that cause authentication failures, particularly when users return to the app after extended periods. This enhancement will address these gaps to create a seamless, professional reading experience.

## Requirements

### Functional

**FR1**: The HomeScreen will display improved visual hierarchy with better spacing, typography, and component organization while maintaining existing functionality for novel browsing and navigation.

**FR2**: The BookDetailsScreen will have enhanced tab navigation, improved content layout, and complete API integration for all sections (Overview, Chapters, Comments, Reviews, Recommendations).

**FR3**: The ReadingScreen will feature improved reading experience with better typography controls, enhanced navigation, and seamless chapter transitions.

**FR4**: All missing UI components will be generated and integrated to create complete, functional pages that match the existing design system.

**FR5**: The authentication system will automatically refresh access tokens before expiration, preventing 403/401 errors during app usage.

**FR6**: The app will handle token refresh seamlessly when users return after extended periods without requiring re-authentication.

**FR7**: All API endpoints will be properly mapped and integrated with appropriate error handling and loading states.

**FR8**: The UI will maintain consistency with existing Material 3 design system and theme configuration.

### Non Functional

**NFR1**: UI improvements must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 15%.

**NFR2**: Token refresh operations must complete within 2 seconds to avoid user-perceived delays.

**NFR3**: The enhanced UI must support the existing minimum SDK 24 and target SDK 35 requirements.

**NFR4**: All new components must follow existing Clean Architecture patterns and Hilt dependency injection.

**NFR5**: API integration must maintain existing error handling patterns and network resilience.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: All existing API endpoints and data models must remain compatible - no breaking changes to backend contracts.

**CR2**: Database schema and Room entities must remain unchanged to preserve existing data.

**CR3**: UI enhancements must maintain consistency with existing Material 3 theme and design tokens.

**CR4**: Authentication flow must remain compatible with existing JWT token structure and Spring Security backend.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The UI enhancements will seamlessly integrate with the existing Material 3 design system and Jetpack Compose architecture. New components will follow the established patterns in `ui/theme/` (Color.kt, Typography, Shapes) and maintain consistency with existing spacing defined in `Spacing.kt`. The enhancements will leverage the current `CustomShapes` and `ReadingThemes` while improving visual hierarchy and user experience.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Modified Screens:**
- `HomeScreen.kt` - Enhanced visual layout, improved component organization, better spacing and typography
- `BookDetailsScreen.kt` - Improved tab navigation, enhanced content sections, complete API integration
- `ReadingScreen.kt` - Better reading experience, improved navigation controls, enhanced typography settings

**New Components to be Generated:**
- Enhanced `BannerCard` component with improved animations
- Improved `NovelCard` with better visual hierarchy
- Enhanced `RankingListItem` with better spacing
- Complete `CommentItem` with reply functionality
- Enhanced `ReviewItem` with better rating display
- Improved `ChapterItem` with progress indicators
- Better loading states and error handling components

### UI Consistency Requirements

- Maintain existing Material 3 color scheme and typography
- Preserve current navigation patterns and user flow
- Ensure all new components follow established spacing guidelines
- Maintain accessibility standards and touch target sizes
- Keep consistent with existing icon usage and visual language

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Kotlin 2.0.21 (Frontend & Backend)  
**Frameworks**: Jetpack Compose 2024.09.00, Spring Boot 3.3.5  
**Database**: MongoDB (Backend), Room 2.6.1 (Frontend)  
**Infrastructure**: Android SDK 24+, JVM 17  
**External Dependencies**: Cloudinary 1.37.0, Coil 2.5.0, Retrofit 2.9.0, Hilt 2.48

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: No changes to existing Room entities or MongoDB schemas. New UI components will use existing data models and repository patterns.

**API Integration Strategy**: Complete existing API mappings using established Retrofit services and DTO patterns. Maintain existing error handling and response processing.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing Compose components following established Clean Architecture patterns. Use existing ViewModels and state management approaches.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Maintain existing test structure. Add UI tests for new components using existing testing patterns.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing package structure in `ui/components/` and `ui/screens/`. New components will be added to appropriate existing directories.

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing Kotlin naming conventions and Compose component naming patterns.

**Coding Standards**: Follow existing Clean Architecture principles, MVVM pattern, and Hilt dependency injection.

**Documentation Standards**: Maintain existing KDoc standards and inline documentation patterns.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No changes to existing Gradle build configuration. New components will be included in existing build process.

**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain existing Android APK build and Spring Boot JAR deployment processes.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Use existing Android Log and SLF4J logging patterns for new functionality.

**Configuration Management**: Maintain existing environment configuration and build variant setup.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- UI changes might impact existing user flows
- Token refresh improvements could introduce new edge cases
- API integration completion might reveal missing backend endpoints

**Integration Risks**: 
- New components might not integrate smoothly with existing state management
- Authentication flow changes could break existing session handling

**Deployment Risks**: 
- UI changes might require extensive testing across different screen sizes
- Token refresh improvements need careful testing to avoid authentication loops

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Incremental UI improvements with thorough testing at each step
- Comprehensive authentication flow testing with various token expiration scenarios
- Maintain backward compatibility while implementing improvements
- Use existing error handling patterns to gracefully handle integration issues
