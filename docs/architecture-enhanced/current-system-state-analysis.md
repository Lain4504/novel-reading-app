# Current System State Analysis

### Existing Architecture Foundation

The Novel Reading App has a solid foundation with:
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured domain, data, and presentation layers
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Kotlin 2.0.21, Jetpack Compose 2024.09.00, Spring Boot 3.3.5
- **Material 3 Design**: Consistent theming system with proper color, typography, and spacing
- **Robust Backend**: Spring Boot with MongoDB, JWT authentication, and Cloudinary integration

### Critical Technical Debt Identified

1. **Authentication Token Management Issues**
   - Token refresh logic scattered across multiple classes
   - 403/401 errors during normal app usage
   - Complex session management in `SessionManager.kt`

2. **Incomplete API Integration**
   - Missing UI components for complete BookDetailsScreen functionality
   - Incomplete API mappings for comments, reviews, and recommendations
   - Basic error handling and loading states

3. **UI/UX Enhancement Opportunities**
   - HomeScreen needs improved visual hierarchy and spacing
   - BookDetailsScreen requires enhanced tab navigation and content layout
   - ReadingScreen needs better typography controls and navigation
