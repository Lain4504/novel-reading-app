# Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Authentication Flow Disruption
- **Impact**: High - Could break user login and app functionality
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Implement new authentication alongside existing system
  - Gradual migration with feature flags
  - Comprehensive testing of authentication flows
  - Rollback plan to existing SessionManager

#### Risk 2: UI Component Integration Issues
- **Impact**: Medium - Could affect user experience
- **Mitigation**:
  - Incremental component replacement
  - Maintain existing component interfaces
  - Extensive UI testing across different screen sizes
  - A/B testing for critical UI changes

#### Risk 3: API Integration Failures
- **Impact**: Medium - Could break existing functionality
- **Mitigation**:
  - Complete API integration testing
  - Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoints
  - Gradual rollout of new API integrations

### Integration Risks

#### Risk 4: Performance Degradation
- **Impact**: Medium - Could affect user experience
- **Mitigation**:
  - Performance testing before and after changes
  - Memory profiling and optimization
  - Gradual rollout with performance monitoring
  - Rollback plan for performance issues

#### Risk 5: Data Consistency Issues
- **Impact**: High - Could affect user data integrity
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive data migration testing
  - Backup and restore procedures
  - Data validation and integrity checks
  - Gradual data migration with validation
