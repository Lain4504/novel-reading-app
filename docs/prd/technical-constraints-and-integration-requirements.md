# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Kotlin 2.0.21 (Frontend & Backend)  
**Frameworks**: Jetpack Compose 2024.09.00, Spring Boot 3.3.5  
**Database**: MongoDB (Backend), Room 2.6.1 (Frontend)  
**Infrastructure**: Android SDK 24+, JVM 17  
**External Dependencies**: Cloudinary 1.37.0, Coil 2.5.0, Retrofit 2.9.0, Hilt 2.48

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: No changes to existing Room entities or MongoDB schemas. New UI components will use existing data models and repository patterns.

**API Integration Strategy**: Complete existing API mappings using established Retrofit services and DTO patterns. Maintain existing error handling and response processing.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing Compose components following established Clean Architecture patterns. Use existing ViewModels and state management approaches.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Maintain existing test structure. Add UI tests for new components using existing testing patterns.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing package structure in `ui/components/` and `ui/screens/`. New components will be added to appropriate existing directories.

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing Kotlin naming conventions and Compose component naming patterns.

**Coding Standards**: Follow existing Clean Architecture principles, MVVM pattern, and Hilt dependency injection.

**Documentation Standards**: Maintain existing KDoc standards and inline documentation patterns.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No changes to existing Gradle build configuration. New components will be included in existing build process.

**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain existing Android APK build and Spring Boot JAR deployment processes.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Use existing Android Log and SLF4J logging patterns for new functionality.

**Configuration Management**: Maintain existing environment configuration and build variant setup.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- UI changes might impact existing user flows
- Token refresh improvements could introduce new edge cases
- API integration completion might reveal missing backend endpoints

**Integration Risks**: 
- New components might not integrate smoothly with existing state management
- Authentication flow changes could break existing session handling

**Deployment Risks**: 
- UI changes might require extensive testing across different screen sizes
- Token refresh improvements need careful testing to avoid authentication loops

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Incremental UI improvements with thorough testing at each step
- Comprehensive authentication flow testing with various token expiration scenarios
- Maintain backward compatibility while implementing improvements
- Use existing error handling patterns to gracefully handle integration issues
