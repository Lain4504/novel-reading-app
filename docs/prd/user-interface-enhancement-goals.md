# User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The UI enhancements will seamlessly integrate with the existing Material 3 design system and Jetpack Compose architecture. New components will follow the established patterns in `ui/theme/` (Color.kt, Typography, Shapes) and maintain consistency with existing spacing defined in `Spacing.kt`. The enhancements will leverage the current `CustomShapes` and `ReadingThemes` while improving visual hierarchy and user experience.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Modified Screens:**
- `HomeScreen.kt` - Enhanced visual layout, improved component organization, better spacing and typography
- `BookDetailsScreen.kt` - Improved tab navigation, enhanced content sections, complete API integration
- `ReadingScreen.kt` - Better reading experience, improved navigation controls, enhanced typography settings

**New Components to be Generated:**
- Enhanced `BannerCard` component with improved animations
- Improved `NovelCard` with better visual hierarchy
- Enhanced `RankingListItem` with better spacing
- Complete `CommentItem` with reply functionality
- Enhanced `ReviewItem` with better rating display
- Improved `ChapterItem` with progress indicators
- Better loading states and error handling components

### UI Consistency Requirements

- Maintain existing Material 3 color scheme and typography
- Preserve current navigation patterns and user flow
- Ensure all new components follow established spacing guidelines
- Maintain accessibility standards and touch target sizes
- Keep consistent with existing icon usage and visual language
