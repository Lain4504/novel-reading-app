# Requirements

### Functional

**FR1**: The HomeScreen will display improved visual hierarchy with better spacing, typography, and component organization while maintaining existing functionality for novel browsing and navigation.

**FR2**: The BookDetailsScreen will have enhanced tab navigation, improved content layout, and complete API integration for all sections (Overview, Chapters, Comments, Reviews, Recommendations).

**FR3**: The ReadingScreen will feature improved reading experience with better typography controls, enhanced navigation, and seamless chapter transitions.

**FR4**: All missing UI components will be generated and integrated to create complete, functional pages that match the existing design system.

**FR5**: The authentication system will automatically refresh access tokens before expiration, preventing 403/401 errors during app usage.

**FR6**: The app will handle token refresh seamlessly when users return after extended periods without requiring re-authentication.

**FR7**: All API endpoints will be properly mapped and integrated with appropriate error handling and loading states.

**FR8**: The UI will maintain consistency with existing Material 3 design system and theme configuration.

### Non Functional

**NFR1**: UI improvements must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 15%.

**NFR2**: Token refresh operations must complete within 2 seconds to avoid user-perceived delays.

**NFR3**: The enhanced UI must support the existing minimum SDK 24 and target SDK 35 requirements.

**NFR4**: All new components must follow existing Clean Architecture patterns and Hilt dependency injection.

**NFR5**: API integration must maintain existing error handling patterns and network resilience.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: All existing API endpoints and data models must remain compatible - no breaking changes to backend contracts.

**CR2**: Database schema and Room entities must remain unchanged to preserve existing data.

**CR3**: UI enhancements must maintain consistency with existing Material 3 theme and design tokens.

**CR4**: Authentication flow must remain compatible with existing JWT token structure and Spring Security backend.
