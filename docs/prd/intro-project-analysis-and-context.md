### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Improve user experience through better UI/UX design
- Complete missing API integrations and UI components
- Eliminate authentication errors that disrupt user experience
- Create a polished, production-ready mobile reading application

#### Background Context
The current Novel Reading App has a solid foundation with Jetpack Compose UI and Spring Boot backend, but the user interface needs refinement and some API integrations are incomplete. Additionally, the token refresh mechanism has issues that cause authentication failures, particularly when users return to the app after extended periods. This enhancement will address these gaps to create a seamless, professional reading experience.
